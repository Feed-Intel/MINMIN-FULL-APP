        Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability
        of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this
        Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
        limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100
        USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the
        Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
        indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
        limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
        information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
        privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability
        to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware
        used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of
        this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the
        possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
        essential purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
        limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
        means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
        each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted
        by law.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl">"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all
        faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent
        permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
        behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and
        service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express,
        implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including
        all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
        purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out
        of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
        Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
        undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service
        will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible
        or work with any other software, applications, systems or services,
        operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability
        standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
        corrected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
        Company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
        express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
        Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included
        thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;
        (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or
        content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its
        servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company
        are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs
        or other harmful components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
        warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer,
        so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
        You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this
        section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under
        applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl">Governing Law</h2>

      <p>
        Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
        performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a
        party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
        any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver
        of any subsequent breach.
      </p>
